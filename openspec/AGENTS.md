# OpenSpec Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: `openspec spec list --long`, `openspec list` (use `rg` only for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks/` directory, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `openspec validate [change-id] --strict` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes
Create proposal when you need to:
- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)
- Change architecture or patterns  
- Optimize performance (changes behavior)
- Update security patterns

Triggers (examples):
- "Help me create a change proposal"
- "Help me plan a change"
- "Help me create a proposal"
- "I want to create a spec proposal"
- "I want to create a spec"

Loose matching guidance:
- Contains one of: `proposal`, `change`, `spec`
- With one of: `create`, `plan`, `make`, `start`, `help`

Skip proposal for:
- Bug fixes (restore intended behavior)
- Typos, formatting, comments
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Configuration changes
- Tests for existing behavior

**Workflow**
1. Review `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `openspec list`, and `openspec list --specs` to understand current context.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks/` directory, optional `design.md`, and spec deltas under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.
3. Draft spec deltas using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement.
4. Run `openspec validate <id> --strict` and resolve any issues before sharing the proposal.

### Stage 2: Implementing Changes
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. **Read proposal.md** - Understand what's being built
2. **Read design.md** (if exists) - Review technical decisions
3. **Read task files** - Get implementation checklist from `tasks/` directory
4. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Complete task files in order (001-*, 002-*, etc.)
5. **Confirm completion** - Ensure every item in each task file is finished before updating statuses
6. **Update checklist** - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the list reflects reality
7. **Approval gate** - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved

### Stage 3: Archiving Changes
After deployment, create separate PR to:
- Move `changes/[name]/` → `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`
- Update `specs/` if capabilities changed
- Use `openspec archive <change-id> --skip-specs --yes` for tooling-only changes (always pass the change ID explicitly)
- Run `openspec validate --strict` to confirm the archived change passes checks

## Before Any Task

**Context Checklist:**
- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts
- [ ] Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for project context and conventions
- [ ] Run `openspec list` to see active changes
- [ ] Run `openspec list --specs` to see existing capabilities

**Before Creating Specs:**
- Always check if capability already exists
- Prefer modifying existing specs over creating duplicates
- Use `openspec show [spec]` to review current state
- If request is ambiguous, ask 1–2 clarifying questions before scaffolding

### Search Guidance
- Enumerate specs: `openspec spec list --long` (or `--json` for scripts)
- Enumerate changes: `openspec list` (or `openspec change list --json` - deprecated but available)
- Show details:
  - Spec: `openspec show <spec-id> --type spec` (use `--json` for filters)
  - Change: `openspec show <change-id> --json --deltas-only`
- Full-text search (use ripgrep): `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs`

## External Issue Tracking

Proposals may reference external issues (Linear, GitHub, Jira, etc.). When detected, track and update them throughout the workflow.

### Detection

When user input contains issue references:
1. Confirm with user: "I detected [issue]. Track and post progress updates?"
2. If confirmed, fetch issue metadata using available tools
3. Store in proposal.md frontmatter:

```yaml
---
tracked-issues:
  - tracker: linear
    id: SM-123
    url: https://linear.app/team/issue/SM-123
---
```

Only store immutable references (tracker, id, url). Fetch current details from the API when needed.

### Updates

Post progress to tracked issues at these points:
- **Proposal created**: Comment linking to the change
- **Section completed**: Comment with progress (batch per section, not per checkbox)
- **Archive complete**: Final summary comment

### User Confirmation

Before any external update, present a summary and wait for confirmation. Never auto-post.

### Tool Usage

Use available tools to interact with issue trackers. If no tools available for a tracker, note the issue URL for manual updates.

## Quick Start

## Creating Change Proposals

### Decision Tree

```
New request?
├─ Bug fix restoring spec behavior? → Fix directly
├─ Typo/format/comment? → Fix directly  
├─ New feature/capability? → Create proposal
├─ Breaking change? → Create proposal
├─ Architecture change? → Create proposal
└─ Unclear? → Create proposal (safer)
```

### Proposal Structure

1. **Create directory:** `changes/[change-id]/` (kebab-case, verb-led, unique)

2. **Write proposal.md:**
```markdown
# Change: [Brief description of change]

## Why
[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]

## What Changes
- [Bullet list of changes]
- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]

## Impact
- Affected specs: [list capabilities]
- Affected code: [key files/systems]
```

3. **Create spec deltas:** `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL provide...

#### Scenario: Success case
- **WHEN** user performs action
- **THEN** expected result

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Existing Feature
[Complete modified requirement]

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Old Feature
**Reason**: [Why removing]
**Migration**: [How to handle]
```
If multiple capabilities are affected, create multiple delta files under `changes/[change-id]/specs/<capability>/spec.md`—one per capability.

4. **Create tasks/ directory:**

Create a `tasks/` directory with numbered task files. Minimum 3 files recommended:
- Implementation task(s): The actual work
- Review task: Verify all changes are complete and consistent
- Test task: Validate behavior meets acceptance criteria

Each task file uses format `NNN-<kebab-case-name>.md` (e.g., `001-implement-core.md`).

Example `tasks/001-implement-feature.md`:
```markdown
# Task: Implement feature

## End Goal
What this task accomplishes.

## Currently
Current state before this task.

## Should
Expected state after this task.

## Constraints
- [ ] Constraint 1
- [ ] Constraint 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema
- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint
- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend component

## Notes
Additional context if needed.
```

**Note:** Checkboxes under `## Constraints` and `## Acceptance Criteria` are ignored when calculating task progress. Only `## Implementation Checklist` checkboxes count.

5. **Create design.md when needed:**
Create `design.md` if any of the following apply; otherwise omit it:
- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or a new architectural pattern
- New external dependency or significant data model changes
- Security, performance, or migration complexity
- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding

Minimal `design.md` skeleton:
```markdown
## Context
[Background, constraints, stakeholders]

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: [...]
- Non-Goals: [...]

## Decisions
- Decision: [What and why]
- Alternatives considered: [Options + rationale]

## Risks / Trade-offs
- [Risk] → Mitigation

## Migration Plan
[Steps, rollback]

## Open Questions
- [...]
```

## Spec File Format

### Critical: Scenario Formatting

**CORRECT** (use #### headers):
```markdown
#### Scenario: User login success
- **WHEN** valid credentials provided
- **THEN** return JWT token
```

**WRONG** (don't use bullets or bold):
```markdown
- **Scenario: User login**  ❌
**Scenario**: User login     ❌
### Scenario: User login      ❌
```

Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

### Requirement Wording
- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)

### Delta Operations

- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities
- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior
- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features
- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes

Headers matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.

#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED
- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding "Slash Command Configuration") rather than altering the semantics of an existing requirement.
- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.
- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.

Common pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren’t explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED instead.

Authoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:
1) Locate the existing requirement in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.
2) Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its scenarios).
3) Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new behavior.
4) Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at least one `#### Scenario:`.

Example for RENAMED:
```markdown
## RENAMED Requirements
- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`
- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**"Change must have at least one delta"**
- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files
- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)

**"Requirement must have at least one scenario"**
- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)
- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers

**Silent scenario parsing failures**
- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`
- Debug with: `openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only`

### Validation Tips

```bash
# Always use strict mode for comprehensive checks
openspec validate [change] --strict

# Debug delta parsing
openspec show [change] --json | jq '.deltas'

# Check specific requirement
openspec show [spec] --json -r 1
```

## Happy Path Script

```bash
# 1) Explore current state
openspec spec list --long
openspec list
# Optional full-text search:
# rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs
# rg -n "^#|Requirement:" openspec/changes

# 2) Choose change id and scaffold
CHANGE=add-two-factor-auth
mkdir -p openspec/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth,tasks}
printf "## Why\n...\n\n## What Changes\n- ...\n\n## Impact\n- ...\n" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md
printf "# Task: Implement feature\n\n## End Goal\n...\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n- [ ] 1.1 ...\n" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/tasks/001-implement.md

# 3) Add deltas (example)
cat > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/specs/auth/spec.md << 'EOF'
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication
Users MUST provide a second factor during login.

#### Scenario: OTP required
- **WHEN** valid credentials are provided
- **THEN** an OTP challenge is required
EOF

# 4) Validate
openspec validate $CHANGE --strict
```

## Best Practices

### Simplicity First
- Default to <100 lines of new code
- Single-file implementations until proven insufficient
- Avoid frameworks without clear justification
- Choose boring, proven patterns

### Complexity Triggers
Only add complexity with:
- Performance data showing current solution too slow
- Concrete scale requirements (>1000 users, >100MB data)
- Multiple proven use cases requiring abstraction

### Clear References
- Use `file.ts:42` format for code locations
- Reference specs as `specs/auth/spec.md`
- Link related changes and PRs

### Capability Naming
- Use verb-noun: `user-auth`, `payment-capture`
- Single purpose per capability
- 10-minute understandability rule
- Split if description needs "AND"

### Change ID Naming
- Use kebab-case, short and descriptive: `add-two-factor-auth`
- Prefer verb-led prefixes: `add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`
- Ensure uniqueness; if taken, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

## Tool Selection Guide

| Task | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Find files by pattern | Glob | Fast pattern matching |
| Search code content | Grep | Optimized regex search |
| Read specific files | Read | Direct file access |
| Explore unknown scope | Task | Multi-step investigation |

## Error Recovery

### Change Conflicts
1. Run `openspec list` to see active changes
2. Check for overlapping specs
3. Coordinate with change owners
4. Consider combining proposals

### Validation Failures
1. Run with `--strict` flag
2. Check JSON output for details
3. Verify spec file format
4. Ensure scenarios properly formatted

### Missing Context
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md first
2. Check related specs
3. Review recent archives
4. Ask for clarification

## Quick Reference

### Stage Indicators
- `changes/` - Proposed, not yet built
- `specs/` - Built and deployed
- `archive/` - Completed changes

### File Purposes
- `proposal.md` - Why and what
- `tasks/` - Implementation steps (directory with numbered files)
- `design.md` - Technical decisions
- `spec.md` - Requirements and behavior

### CLI Essentials
```bash
openspec list              # What's in progress?
openspec show [item]       # View details
openspec validate --strict # Is it correct?
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]  # Mark complete (add --yes for automation)
```

Remember: Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.
