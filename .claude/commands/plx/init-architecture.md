**Guardrails**
- Focus on practical, usable documentation that enables feature planning.
- Document patterns and conventions, not implementation details.
- Keep the document maintainable - avoid copying code.
- Structure information for quick reference and navigation.

**Steps**
1. Read the project's manifest files to identify technology stack and dependencies.
2. Explore the directory structure to understand project organization.
3. Identify key patterns: services, APIs, state management, routing, etc.
4. Create ARCHITECTURE.md at the project root with comprehensive documentation.
5. Include: Project setup, tech stack, folder structure, service patterns, state management, and conventions.
6. Ensure the document is practical and usable for feature planning without additional codebase research.
