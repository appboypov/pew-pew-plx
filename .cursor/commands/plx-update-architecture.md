**Guardrails**
- Focus on practical, usable documentation that enables feature planning.
- Document patterns and conventions, not implementation details.
- Keep the document maintainable - avoid copying code.
- Structure information for quick reference and navigation.

**Steps**
1. Read the existing ARCHITECTURE.md to understand current documentation state.
2. Explore the codebase for any new patterns, services, or architectural changes.
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect the current state of the codebase.
4. Preserve user-added content that doesn't conflict with generated sections.
5. Ensure all sections remain accurate and complete for feature planning.
