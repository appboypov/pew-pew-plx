# Task: Verify update-refine-architecture change is complete

## End Goal

All changes are complete, validated, and ready for merge.

## Currently

Implementation and testing tasks may be complete but final verification not done.

## Should

All implementation verified, tests pass, validation passes, and change is ready for archive.

## Constraints

- [ ] Must run full validation suite
- [ ] Must verify no TypeScript errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `plx validate change --id update-refine-architecture --strict` passes
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes
- [ ] All tool command files are in sync

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] 3.1 Run `plx validate change --id update-refine-architecture --strict`
- [x] 3.2 Run `pnpm build`
- [x] 3.3 Run `pnpm test`
- [x] 3.4 Verify git status shows expected changed files
- [ ] 3.5 Create commit with changes

## Notes

Expected changed files:
- `src/core/templates/slash-command-templates.ts`
- All `.*/commands/*/refine-architecture.*` files (regenerated by plx update)
