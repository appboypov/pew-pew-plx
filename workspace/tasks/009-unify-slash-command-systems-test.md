# Task: Validate Behavior

## End Goal
The unified slash command system works correctly end-to-end.

## Currently
Implementation and review tasks are complete.

## Should
Verify:
- All 13 commands are generated by `plx update`
- Build and tests pass
- Commands have correct content

## Constraints
- [ ] Must test actual command generation, not just types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm test` passes (all 1000+ tests)
- [ ] `plx update` generates 13 command files
- [ ] Generated files have correct frontmatter and content

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] 9.1 Run `npm run build`
- [x] 9.2 Run `npm test`
- [x] 9.3 Delete existing `.claude/commands/plx/` directory
- [x] 9.4 Run `plx update`
- [x] 9.5 Verify 13 `.md` files in `.claude/commands/plx/`
- [x] 9.6 Spot-check `plan-request.md` and `plan-proposal.md` content
- [x] 9.7 Verify no duplicate or orphan files

## Notes
The end-to-end test confirms the entire pipeline works.
