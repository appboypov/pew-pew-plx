## Context

The Pew Pew Plx fork introduced a separate "PLX slash command" system alongside the original "regular slash command" system. This dual architecture was intended to keep fork-specific commands separate from core OpenSpec commands. However:

1. PLX is now the primary identity - separation no longer adds value
2. The dual system causes confusion and implementation bugs
3. 52 nearly-identical configurator files is wasteful

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Single unified slash command type and registry
- Delete ~27 redundant `plx-*.ts` files
- Eliminate architectural confusion
- All 13 commands generated by `plx update`

**Non-Goals:**
- Changing command behavior or content
- Modifying the marker system
- Changing file output paths

## Decisions

**Decision: Keep regular file names, drop "Plx" prefix**
- Keep: `SlashCommandId`, `base.ts`, `claude.ts`, `registry.ts`
- Delete: `PlxSlashCommandId`, `plx-base.ts`, `plx-claude.ts`, `plx-registry.ts`
- Rationale: Simpler naming, replaces current regular files with expanded versions

**Decision: Merge command bodies into single record**
- All 13 command bodies in `slashCommandBodies`
- Single `getSlashCommandBody()` function
- Rationale: Single source of truth

**Decision: Remove workspaceDir parameter**
- PLX system didn't use it
- Regular system's `generateAll(projectPath, workspaceDir)` becomes `generateAll(projectPath)`
- Rationale: Simplification, parameter was unused

## Risks / Trade-offs

**Risk: Large file deletion**
- Mitigation: Git history preserves deleted code
- Mitigation: Single atomic commit for easy revert

**Risk: Test coverage gaps**
- Mitigation: Existing parity tests become regular tests
- Mitigation: Run full test suite before/after

## Migration Plan

1. Merge templates (types + bodies)
2. Merge base configurator
3. Update each tool configurator (23 files)
4. Delete PLX files
5. Update init.ts and update.ts
6. Update tests
7. Verify with `npm run build && npm test && plx update`

**Rollback:** Git revert single merge commit

## Open Questions

None - approach is straightforward deletion/merge.
